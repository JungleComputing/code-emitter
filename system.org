* Setting up the system

The following code shows how the system is defined.  The system contains a main
file ~code-emitter.lisp~ and a file ~test-code-emitter.lisp~.

#+begin_src lisp :tangle "system/code-emitter.asd" :noweb yes
<<license-preamble>>

(in-package :cl-user)

(defpackage :code-emitter-asd
  (:use :cl :asdf))

(in-package :code-emitter-asd)

(defsystem :code-emitter
    :depends-on (:cl-ppcre :alexandria :cl-strings :split-sequence :utility-directory)
    :components ((:file "packages" )
		 (:file "code-emitter" :depends-on ("packages"))))

(defsystem :code-emitter/tests
    :depends-on (:fiveam :code-emitter)
    :components ((:file "test-code-emitter")))
#+end_src

The file ~packages.lisp~ defines the two packages ~:code-emitter~ and
~:test-code-emitter~.
